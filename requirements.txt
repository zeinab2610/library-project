# Project Requirements
# --------------------

# This file lists the project's Python dependencies and provides setup instructions.

# Python:
# Version: 3.6 or higher
# Download and install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

# pip:
# Version: The latest version is recommended
# pip is the package installer for Python. It comes pre-installed with Python 3.4+
# You can upgrade pip using the following command:
# python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):
# It's recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.
# This helps prevent conflicts between different projects' dependencies.
# You can create a virtual environment using the following command:
# python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment:
# On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS and Linux: source venv/bin/activate

#you might have to install some libraries such as numpy..

## To run the project, follow these steps:

# 1. Download the project source code from the provided URL.

# 2. Set up the virtual environment (recommended):
# python -m venv venv
# On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS and Linux: source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install project dependencies from the requirements.txt file:
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Create a new database for the project in your preferred database management system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).

# 5. Update the database settings in your project's settings.py file to match your database configuration.

# Example settings for PostgreSQL:
# DATABASES = {
#     'default': {
#         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
#         'NAME': 'your_database_name',
#         'USER': 'your_database_user',
#         'PASSWORD': 'your_database_password',
#         'HOST': 'localhost',
#         'PORT': '5432',
#     }
# }

# 6. Apply initial database migrations to set up the database schema:
# python manage.py migrate

# 7. Create a superuser to access the project's admin interface:
# python manage.py createsuperuser

# 8. Launch the development server:
# python manage.py runserver

# 9. Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to access the project.

# Conclusion:
# With Python and pip installed, the virtual environment activated, the database set up and settings updated, and migrations applied, you're ready to run the project.
# Remember to regularly update your dependencies and keep your environment clean and organized.
